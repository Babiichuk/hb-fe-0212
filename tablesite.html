            <h1>Why do we need tables</h1>
            <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;A table in HTML makes a lot of sense when you want to organize data that would look best in a spreadsheet.
              An HTML table is a great way to display things such as financial data, calendars, pricing, feature comparison,
              the nutrition facts information panel, bowling scores, and many other tabular data.</p>
              <p>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;There is a chance you have heard that the tables were unsemantic. However, that is not at all true.
                Tables semantically indicate tabular data and they are the best choice for displaying data of this kind.</p>
